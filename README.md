This is a basic interpreter implementation in C. Program takes code written in a custom defined grammar and executes it. The interpreter builds the symbol table, supports if else conditions along with nested if else conditions. Jump statements are also supported. Input can be given to the symbols or directly to the 8 registers defined. The implementation includes building a symbol table, building the intermediate code for execution, building the label table for jump statements, the if-else stack for nested if else cases and finally the memory block where the memory of the variables and constants are stored.
